There are two versions of MESMA (Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis) code. The method combination is in the run_mesma_vX.pro file.

I also provide the python code for check and pickup the most popular combination in an image.

MESMA is using an linear or non-linear method with the weight trained from the spectral library. 
ICA is using linear method without any training.
